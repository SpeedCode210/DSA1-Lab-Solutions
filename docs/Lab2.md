# Lab 2
The folder *src/Lab2* contains the solutions to the 15 problems given in the second lab worksheet.
We can run the task number X by running the command ``g++ ./src/Lab2/taskX.cpp -o taskX``.
Here's a short description of each solution :
- `task1.cpp`  : Computes a salary raise given the percentage.
- `task2.cpp`  : Calculates the permieter of a rectangle given its dimensions.
- `task3.cpp`  : Calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.
- `task4.cpp`  : Outputs the volume of a $10\times 10 \times 10$ cube (unit is centimeters).
- `task5.cpp`  : Convert a number of days entered by the user to years, weeks, and days.
- `task6.cpp`  : Take an integer as input and print its multiplication table up to 10.
- `task7.cpp`  : Shows the size in bytes of fundamental data types (bool, char, short, int, long, float, and double).
- `task8.cpp`  : Finds the maximum of two numbers using the conditional operator.
- `task9.cpp`  : Finds the maximum of three numbers using the conditional operator.
- `task10.cpp` : Checks whether a number is Even or Odd.
- `task11.cpp` : Given a real number, calculates its absolute value, exponential (impossible for too large numbers due to memory limitations), root (impossible for negative numbers), and logarithm (impossible for nonpositive numbers).
- `task12.cpp` : Calculates the power of two numbers ($a^b$, given $a$ and $b$).
- `task13.cpp` : Shows the ASCII value of a character entered by the user.
- `task14.cpp` : Checks whether a character is a Vowel or a Consonant, or a Special Character.
- `task15.cpp` : Takes the marks of 5 subjects of a student as input, and displays the total marks, the average, and the
percentage scored.
