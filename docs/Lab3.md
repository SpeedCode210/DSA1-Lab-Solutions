# Lab 3
The folder *src/Lab3* contains the solutions to the 10 problems given in the third lab worksheet.
We can run the task number X by running the command ``g++ ./src/Lab3/taskX.cpp -o taskX``.
Here's a short description of each solution :
- `task1.cpp`  : Given three angles in degrees, figures out if they can be the 3 angles of a triangle.
- `task2.cpp`  : Finds the complex roots of a degree-2 polynomial in $\mathbb R[x]$.
- `task3.cpp`  : Dermines a student's grade based on his quiz, midterm and final exam scores.
- `task4.cpp`  : Generates a sequence of 420 random numbers, and asks the user to guess their sum.
- `task5.cpp`  : Computes the sum of 10 given integers.
- `task6.cpp`  : Computes the sum of the first $N$ odd positive integers.
- `task7.cpp`  : Computes the mean of a list of given positive integers, and stops execution when entereing 0.
- `task8.cpp`  : Finds the number of occurences of the highest number in a list of 10 given integers.
- `task9.cpp`  : Reverses the digits of a given positive integer (trailing zeros get turned into leading zeros and are still displayed).
- `task10.cpp` : Generates a pyramid with a given height, symbol, and padding, and reverses it if asked (Additional feature, display two pyramids on demand to make a rhombus).
