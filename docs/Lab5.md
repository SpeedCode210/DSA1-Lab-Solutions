# Lab 5
The folder *src/Lab5* contains the solutions to the 3 first problems given in the fifth lab worksheet Part one, and the ask 1of Part two.
- We can run the task number X for the tasks of the first part by running the command ``g++ ./src/Lab5/taskX.cpp -o taskX``.
- For the second part, `cd` into the folder `src/Lab5/primesWithCmake`, and run `make run` to test the functions implemented, and `make clean` to delete the compiled files.
