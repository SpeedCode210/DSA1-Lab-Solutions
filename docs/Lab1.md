# Lab 1
The folder *src/Lab1* contains the solutions to the 6 problems given in the first lab worksheet.
We can run the task number X by running the command ``g++ ./src/taskX.cpp``.
Here's a short description of each solution :
- `task1.cpp` : Takes two integers as an input and outputs their sum to the standard I/O
- `task2.cpp` : Takes two integers as an input into two variables, swaps their value **without using a thrid variable** and outputs their values.
- `task3.cpp` : Takes two integers as an input, outputs their sum, then their difference, then their product, then their integer division result, and their modulo ($FirstNumber \pmod {SecondNumber}$).
- `task4.cpp` : Given the dimentions of a rectangles, it outputs its perimeter.
- `task5.cpp` : Given the radius of a circle, outputs on the same line its area then its circumference.
- `task6.cpp` : Outputs the volume of a $10\times 10 \times 10$ cube (unit is centimeters).
